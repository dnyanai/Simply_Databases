## Two types of memories:
a. RAM - used to store temporary store programs that a computer is running and is lost when the computer is turned off. Volatile, RW memory.  
b. ROM - contains permanent data i.e programs and information essential to operation of a computer. Non-Volatile, cannot be changed.  

## Internal working of every computer can be broken down into 3 parts:
a. CPU - process information stored in the memory, uses Buses to get information or send information to others.  
b. Memory 
c. I/O devices - keyboard or mouse like devices, to provide means of communicating with the CPU. To be recognized by the CPU, it each I/O device should have an address (unique).
d. Bus - CPU is connected with the memory and I/O devices through stripes of wire called as bus. Carries information from place to place, 3 types: (i) Address Bus, (ii) Data Bus, (iii) Control Bus.
