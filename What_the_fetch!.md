## Two types of memories:
a. RAM - used to store temporary store programs that a computer is running and is lost when the computer is turned off. Volatile, RW memory.  
b. ROM - contains permanent data i.e programs and information essential to operation of a computer. Non-Volatile, cannot be changed.  

## Internal working of every computer can be broken down into 3 parts:
a. CPU - process information stored in the memory, uses Buses to get information or send information to others. <br> 
b. Memory <br>
c. I/O devices - keyboard or mouse like devices, to provide means of communicating with the CPU. To be recognized by the CPU, it each I/O device should have an address (unique). <br>
d. Bus - CPU is connected with the memory and I/O devices through stripes of wire called as bus. Carries information from place to place, 
   <br>3 types: <ul>(i) Address Bus,</ul> <ul>(ii) Data Bus,</ul> <ul>(iii) Control Bus.</ul>
